This MATLAB code is written as part of the course project for COMP 765 - Advanced Topics (Mobile Robotics) at McGill University, Canada. It demonstrates the CAMSHIFT algorithm for object tracking in videos.

The code can be run from the main file - "CAMSHIFT.m"
After running the main file, it needs, as input, the four vertices of the initial search window around the object (robot) to be tracked.
